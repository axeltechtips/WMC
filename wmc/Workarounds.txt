In that case just launch the new reset settings script once

The DVD player should be installed automatically by WMC, if for same reason it does not work, do it manually using the instructionas below

After installing the pack and starting WMC, check Windows Update to see if it installs Update KB3081704

This shouldn't needed anymore in WMC V8.7, but just in case.... 

To have WMC to wake up for recordings, you may need to make "NETWORK SERVICE" a member of the administrator group

Run lusrmgr.msc, or right-click on Start button and select: Computer Management > Local users & Groups
then:
Groups > Administrators > Add > "network service" > Check names > OK

or directly use command prompt as admin:
for /f "usebackq delims=" %x in (`powershell "(New-Object System.Security.Principal.SecurityIdentifier('S-1-5-32-544')).Translate([System.Security.Principal.NTAccount]).Value.Split([IO.Path]::DirectorySeparatorChar)[1]"`) do set "admins=%x"
for /f "usebackq delims=" %x in (`powershell "(New-Object System.Security.Principal.SecurityIdentifier('S-1-5-20')).Translate([System.Security.Principal.NTAccount]).Value"`) do set "netsvc=%x"
net localgroup %admins% "%netsvc%" /add
